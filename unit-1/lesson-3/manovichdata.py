numerical = [
    "A new media object can be described formally (mathematically). For instance, an image or a shape can be described using a mathematical function.",
    "A new media object is subject to algorichmic manipulation.",
    "media becomes programmable."   
]

modularity = [
    "Just as a fractal has the same structure on different scales, a mew media object. has the same modular structure throughout.",
    "These elements are assembled into larger-scale objects but continue co maintain their separate identities.",
    "hen an“object” is inserted into a document(for instance, a media clip inserted into. a Word document), ie continues to maintain its independence and can always be edited with the program originally used to create it"
]

automation = [
    "Finally, in what may be the most familiar experience of automated media generation, many Web sites automatically generate Web pages on the fly when the user reaches the site.",
    ", In short, computer characters can display incelligence and skills only because pro- grams place severe limits on our possible interactions with them. Puc differ- ently, computers can pretend to be intelligent only by tricking us into using a very small part of whe we are when we communicate with them",
    "By the end of the twentieth century, the problem was mo longer how to create a new media object such as an image; the new problem was how to find an object that already exists somewhere"
]

variability = [
    "Thus the principle of variability is closely connected00 automation.",
    " Because the same machine is used as both showroom and factory, that is, the same computer generates. and displays media—and because the media exists not as a material cbject but as dara that can be sent through wires at the speed of light, the customized version created in response to che uset’s input is delivered almost immediately. Thus, to continue with the same example, when you access a Web site, the server immediately assembles a customized Web page.",
    "Here are some particular cases of the variability principle (most of them will be discussed in more detail in lacer chapters):"
]

transcoding = [
    "Beginning with the basic,“material” principles of new media—mumeric coding and modular organization—we moved to more “deep” and. farreaching ones—automation and variability.",
    "The structure of a computer image is a case in point. On the level of representation, it belongs on the side of human culeure, automatically entering in dialog with other images, other cultural“semes” and “mythemes.",
    "Of course, what I call“the compuser layer” is not itself fixed burt rarher changes over time."
