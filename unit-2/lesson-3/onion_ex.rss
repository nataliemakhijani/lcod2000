<p>CHICAGO—Realizing there comes a time when everyone crashes into a window, local man Danny Nagler told reporters Wednesday that a dead bird on the sidewalk had led him to contemplate his own inevitable collision with plate glass. “Seeing this bird&#8217;s lifeless body lying here on the pavement, I can’t help but be reminded that someday I too will slam headfirst into a large pane of glass at great speed,” said Nagler, pondering how no living thing on the planet had the power to escape the unavoidable reality of smashing directly into a window display and plummeting to the concrete with a broken neck. “The crazy thing is that I, like this bird, probably won’t even see the plate glass coming. I can try all I want to convince myself that my impact with the side of a modern office building won’t happen, but as this bird found out, it’s no use.” At press time, an inconsolable Nagler reportedly got the call that his sickly grandmother had finally met her pane of plate glass.</p>

<p>SALT LAKE CITY—Saying he had learned his lesson following his suspensions by the NBA for two incidents in which he brandished firearms, a reformed Ja Morant told reporters Wednesday that he was way more into swords now. “I did some soul-searching during my time away from the game, and I realized guns should have no place in my life when swords look sick as hell and never get jammed or run out of ammo,” the Grizzlies point guard said before his team&#8217;s season opener against the Jazz, resting a massive 3.1-shaku ōdachi over his shoulder as he explained that while his main priority would be &#8220;big ass&#8221; swords like claymores and zweihänders, all edged weapons—from shamshirs and falchions to kunai and kukris—would be a focus for him going forward. “Owning guns made me a liability to my team, but owning a rapier and parrying dagger combo will let me effortlessly redirect opponents’ attacks while targeting gaps in their armor. That’s so much cooler than just blasting somebody. Thanks to my fans and my new sponsors at [sword and knife retailer] Cold Steel for helping me turn this corner in my life.” At press time, Morant had received a 25-game suspension after an Instagram video showed him intoxicated and performing the forbidden Whirlwind Slash technique outside a Salt Lake City nightclub.</p>

<p>JUPITER, FL—In a tragic incident that has left MAGA world reeling, 55-year-old television personality Kimberly Guilfoyle reportedly died Wednesday after attempting to remove her makeup. “Unfortunately, it appears the makeup was really the only thing holding her face structurally together at this point,” said a medical responder who spoke with reporters on the condition of anonymity and confirmed that everything from Guilfoyle’s eyebrows to her lips had “slid right off” after she applied micellar water to her face, leaving a gruesome scene behind and exposing her bare skull. “It was absolutely horrific. She likely would have succumbed anyway, given the combined weight of makeup, lash extensions, and fillers dragging her face down, but it is a tragedy nonetheless. Hopefully her death can serve as a wake-up call to others, such as Lara Trump and Gov. Kristi Noem.” At press time, sources added that for a moment before her death, Guilfoyle looked kind of beautiful.</p>

<p>According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, breast reduction surgery has surged, growing 64% from 2019 to 2023. Here is what you need to know about the increasingly common elective procedure.</p>



<p><strong>Q: Who is a good candidate for breast reduction surgery?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>A: Anyone whose breasts are medically designated as honkers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Q: Why do women choose breast reduction surgery?</strong></p>



<p>A: As a personal attack on men.</p>



<p><strong>Q: Can you still breastfeed after a reduction?</strong></p>



<p>A: Yes, but the milk will be 2%.</p>



<p><strong>Q: What should I look for in a surgeon?</strong></p>



<p>A: Anyone who’s board certified and doesn’t say, “aw, what a shame” when you say you want it done.</p>



<p><strong>Q: Can men get a breast reduction?</strong></p>



<p>A: Plastic surgeons are more than happy to take money from anybody for any reason.</p>



<p><strong>Q: How does a reduction affect nipple sensation?</strong></p>



<p>A: Most things are more pleasurable when you’re no longer drowning in your own tits.</p>



<p><strong>Q: How will I be able to identify the women in my life if they choose to change their breast size?</strong></p>



<p>A: You can start by familiarizing yourself with their heads and faces, many of which can be just as distinctive.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Q: What’s a well-known consequence of the surgery?</strong></p>



<p>A: Losing acting roles to Sydney Sweeney.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Q: Are people going to be weird about it?</strong></p>



<p>A: The world is going to be really weird about your body whether you have surgery or not.</p>

<p>SANTA FE, NM—Offering fans a tantalizing glimpse into what he’s been working on for nearly 15 years, bestselling author George R.R. Martin announced this week that he had written every &#8220;and&#8221; that would appear in his long-awaited novel <em>The Winds Of Winter</em>. “I know there has been much speculation about whether I&#8217;m truly committed to finishing the sixth book in the <em>Song Of Ice And Fire</em> series, but I&#8217;ve been hard at work perfecting the conjunctions,” said Martin, revealing that page 340 of the forthcoming volume would include 11 uses of the word &#8220;and.&#8221; “Now all that’s left to do is fill in the gaps with a plot, setting, and characters. I’m still mulling over whether an ‘and’ or ‘or’ makes more sense to connect the sentences describing how Tyrion cuts off Bran&#8217;s head in an unforeseen twist I’m planning, but I’ll probably end up just flipping a coin.” The author went on to promise fans he would finish writing every instance of &#8220;the&#8221; by early 2028.</p>

<p>KANSAS CITY, MO—Quieting doubts from supporters that he wasn&#8217;t focused enough on getting a win on the board for the Aryan people, NFL place-kicker Harrison Butker insisted Tuesday that he wouldn’t let politics distract him from the upcoming race war. “I feel obligated to push back when someone audaciously suggests women shouldn’t be relegated to the role of silent breeding machines, but I’m still fully committed to ensuring the white race reigns supreme once the blood has dried,” Butker said while tightening his wife’s corset and suggesting a few finishing touches on her makeup routine to emphasize her more Caucasian features. “I know a lot of people want me to just shut up and prepare my torches for battle against the impure races, but I won’t back down from leering at sluts and chastising whores to set a good example for young men and women. Let me state one more time so there’s no confusion about where my priorities are: When the white race wins, we all win.” At press time, Butker’s wife admitted her girdle no longer fit because she was pregnant with Colin Kaepernick’s child.</p>

<p>NEW YORK—Featuring nearly identical video footage in two separate $25 million ad buys, the Donald Trump and Kamala Harris campaigns both debuted new commercials Tuesday that attempt to win support for their respective candidates with a supercut of Trump’s most racist comments. The two ads—which reports confirmed would air continuously until Nov. 5—showcase clips of Trump’s inflammatory remarks about Jewish people, Black people, and immigrants, including those in which the GOP candidate says “we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now” and suggests new arrivals to the country were poisoning American blood. Both spots reportedly show Trump expounding on conspiracy theories that the Biden administration was “going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas” affected by Hurricane Helene, and both claim in large letters that “This is what the next four years would look like under Trump.” However, sources indicated there is a difference in tone between the two ads, with one using sinister music and the other employing a rousing, triumphal score. Numerous viewers told reporters that only at the very end were they able to determine which candidate each ad was supporting, because one spot said “Stop Donald Trump” and the other said “Vote Donald Trump.”</p>

<p>STANFORD, CA—Concluding that the window in which to give themselves a little pat on the back was rapidly closing, a report released Monday by Stanford University found that Americans needed to cut carbon emissions by 3% in order to tell themselves they did their best. “It’s clear that as the planet continues to grow hotter, U.S. residents have no choice but to slightly lower emissions if they want to rationalize their actions by thinking they did everything they possibly could,” said head researcher Albert Sikora, explaining that anything less than 3% would be insufficient to completely absolve Americans’ sense of guilt over having failed to meet the moment and prevent a climate disaster. “Time is of the essence if we want to have any hope of convincing ourselves that we gave reining in fossil fuels the old college try. It is up to each and every one of us to work together to marginally cut airborne carbon as a way of safeguarding ourselves from accusations that something more should have been done.” At press time, Sikora warned that if the United States failed to act now, it would have no plausible deniability for the death and destruction that record-breaking storms, heat, floods, and drought will inevitably bring.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON—In an attempt to sow further doubt about the vice president&#8217;s employment history, Donald Trump accused Kamala Harris Monday of lying about having a job at the White House. &#8220;Phony Kamala says she worked in a junior position at the White House for years, but they say they&#8217;ve got no record of her being there,&#8221; the former president said during an appearance at a campaign rally, following up on a Truth Social post in which he wrote the phrase &#8220;NEVER WORKED THERE&#8221; under an image of the White House. &#8220;She&#8217;s made it this huge part of her campaign, but why haven&#8217;t we seen a single photograph of her in the Oval Office? Because it&#8217;s a lie, folks. She hasn&#8217;t spent a second there. She just wants to pander to the people who actually were employed there.&#8221; At press time, Trump had devoted a 15-minute campaign stop to working at the White House in an apparent effort to show up Harris and fuel greater uncertainty about her claims.</p>
